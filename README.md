# Flutter Launchpad

A new platform for devs to receive feedback and find testers for their apps. Hoping to make the process of getting an app to the deployment stage a tiny bit easier with a dedicated platform so devs can reach the 20 tester requirement. Also great for apps that you are building for iOS, web, games, or apps that are already released.

Developers can include public test links so all users can join -- users that test and provide quality feedback earm Dev Bits which can be used for rewards or free promotion in the future.

Developers can also export a list of emails to invite testers to a private test track once users request to test your app.

## How it works

Add your app -> Provide opinions on other apps -> Test apps -> Earn bits -> Gain feedback on your own app(s) -> Then laumch with confidence
